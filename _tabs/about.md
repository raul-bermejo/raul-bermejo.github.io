Hola üëã I'm a passionate data professional with academic and industry experience in data science and data engineering. In my work, I use predictive analytics and AI/ML to solve real world problems that produce insights for organizations. I also enjoy crafting data visualisations to enable better data-driven decisions. 

Currently, I work as a Data Science freelancer. Some of the organizations I've had the pleasure to work with include [Multitudes](https://www.multitudes.co/), [Wildlife.ai](https://www.wildlife.ai/about/) and [Manat≈´ M≈ç Te Taiao (Ministry for the Environment)](https://environment.govt.nz/). I'm also a Fellow at the [Good Data Institute](https://www.gooddatainstitute.com/), where we accelerate social and environmental impact by designing, developing and building data capabilities for not-for-profits. I have limited availability at the moment, but if you think my work could bring value to your organisation, feel free [reach out by email](mailto:raulbv.personal@gmail.com) or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-bermejo-059b94208/) and we can set up a chat.  You can also [meet my digital alter-ego on GitHub](https://github.com/raul-bermejo).

I'm very interested in a wide range of environmental and data/AI issues, including sustainability, climate action, data ethics, AI/ML alignment and using tech for good. If you are interested or invested in any of these topics, reach out to me and I'd be happy to have a catch-up.

My academic background is in computational cosmology. I've contributed to dark matter research by applying [topological data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) to numerical simulations of the [cosmic web](https://bigthink.com/hard-science/cosmic-web/) - the largest observable structure in nature. You can find my research paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14655).


Offline, I like reading, discovering new music, and I love spending time outdoors (especially hiking, surfing, skiing and trail running). I also like to reflect on ways I can minimise my environmental impact. I'm always challenging and looking for ways I can improve the way I walk the talk (which is very far from perfect).
