I"’<p>Hola üëã I‚Äôm a passionate data professional with academic and industry experience in data science and data engineering. In my work, I‚Äôve used predictive analytics and AI/ML to solve real world problems that produce insights for organizations. I also enjoy crafting data visualisations to enable better data-driven decisions. I am certified in the following:</p>

</ul>

<p>Currently, I work as a Data Engineer at <a href="https://versent.com.au/">Versent</a>, mostly working around the Databricks ecosystem and PySpark. Some of the organizations I‚Äôve had the pleasure to work with in the past include <a href="https://www.multitudes.co/">Multitudes</a>, <a href="https://www.wildlife.ai/about/">Wildlife.ai</a> and <a href="https://environment.govt.nz/">Manat≈´ M≈ç Te Taiao (Ministry for the Environment)</a>. I‚Äôm also a Fellow at the <a href="https://www.gooddatainstitute.com/">Good Data Institute</a>, where we accelerate social and environmental impact by designing, developing and building data capabilities for not-for-profits. I have limited availability at the moment, but if you think my work could bring value to your organisation, feel free <a href="mailto:raulbv.personal@gmail.com">reach out by email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-bermejo-059b94208/">connect with me on LinkedIn</a> and we can set up a chat.  You can also <a href="https://github.com/raul-bermejo">meet my digital alter-ego on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm very interested in a wide range of environmental and data/AI issues, including sustainability, climate action, data ethics, AI/ML alignment and using tech for good. If you are interested or invested in any of these topics, reach out to me and I‚Äôd be happy to have a catch-up.</p>

<p>My academic background is in computational cosmology. I‚Äôve contributed to dark matter research by applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis</a> to numerical simulations of the <a href="https://bigthink.com/hard-science/cosmic-web/">cosmic web</a> - the largest observable structure in nature. You can find my research paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14655">here</a>.</p>

<p>Offline, I like reading, discovering new music, and I love spending time outdoors (especially hiking, surfing, skiing and trail running). I also like to reflect on ways I can minimise my environmental impact. I‚Äôm always challenging and looking for ways I can improve the way I walk the talk (which is very far from perfect).</p>
