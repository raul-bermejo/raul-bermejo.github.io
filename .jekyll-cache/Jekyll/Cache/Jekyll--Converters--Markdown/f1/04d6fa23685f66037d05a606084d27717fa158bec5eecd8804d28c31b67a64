I"L<p>I’m a passionate data professional with 3+ years of academic and industry experience in data science and engineering. In my work I use predictive analytics and AI/ML to solve real world problems that produce insights for organizations. I also enjoy crafting data visualisations to enable better data-driven decisions.
Some of the organizations I’ve had the pleasure to work with include: <a href="https://www.multitudes.co/">Multitudes</a>, <a href="https://www.wildlife.ai/about/">Wildlife.ai</a> and <a href="https://environment.govt.nz/">Manatū Mō Te Taiao (Ministry for the Environment)</a>. You can <a href="https://github.com/raul-bermejo">meet my digital alter-ego on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Some topics I’m very interested in include: sustainability, climate action, plant-based protein production, data ethics, AI/ML alignment and using tech for good. I’m a Fellow at the <a href="https://www.gooddatainstitute.com/">Good Data Institute</a>, where we accelerate social and environmental impact by designing, developing and building data capabilities for not-for-profits.
If you are interested or invested in any of these topics, feel free to <a href="mailto:raulbv.personal@gmail.com">reach out by email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-bermejo-059b94208/">connect with me on LinkedIn</a> for a catch-up.</p>

<p>My academic background is in computational cosmology. I’ve contributed to dark matter research by applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis</a> to numerical simulations of the <a href="https://bigthink.com/hard-science/cosmic-web/">cosmic web</a> - the largest observable structure in nature. You can find my research paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14655">here</a>.</p>

<p>Offline, I like reading, discovering new music, and I love spending time outdoors (especially hiking, surfing, skiing and trail running). I also like to reflect on ways I can minimise my environmental impact. I’m always challenging and looking for ways I can improve the way I walk the talk (which is very far from perfect).</p>
